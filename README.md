# Musixholic
A modern, interactive web-based music player built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project features a dynamic, blurred background that syncs with the track's artwork, creating an immersive visual experience. The player is fully interactive, with a feature-rich interface that allows users to manage a playlist, control playback with both on-screen UI and keyboard shortcuts, and reorder tracks using a drag-and-drop system.

Here’s a list of the key features we built, which you can use to describe the project:

• Dynamic UI: The application background blurs and syncs with the album art of the currently playing song.

• Full Playback Control: Standard play, pause, next, and previous track buttons.

• Interactive Playlist Management:

• Add songs to the playlist from a master library using a dropdown menu.

• Delete songs from the active playlist.

• Reorder songs seamlessly with a drag-and-drop interface.

• Keyboard Shortcuts:

   - Spacebar: Play/Pause

   - Right Arrow: Seek forward 10 seconds

   - Left Arrow: Seek backward 10 seconds

• Visual Feedback: The currently playing song is highlighted in the playlist, and visual cues indicate when an item is being dragged.
